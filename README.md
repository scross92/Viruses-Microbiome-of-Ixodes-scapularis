# Co-infection Patterns in individual Ixodes scapularis ticks
This respository includes a list of scripts and formatted data sets used to analyze the data curated in the publication titled, "Co-infection patterns in individual Ixodes scapularis ticks reveal possible functional interactions between viral, eukaryotic, and bacterial microorganisms." in the journal Viruses.

The purpose of this project was to look at the Ixodes scapularis tick microbiome in a holistic manner using shotgun metagenomic sequencing. From this holistic view, we aimed to identify potential functional relationships as identified by either co-occurrence or correlation trends.
