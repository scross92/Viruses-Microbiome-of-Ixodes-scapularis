# Co-infection Patterns in individual Ixodes scapularis ticks
This respository includes a list of scripts and formatted data sets used to analyze the data curated in the publication titled, "Co-Infection Patterns in Individual Ixodes scapularis Ticks Reveal Associations between Viral, Eukaryotic and Bacterial Microorganisms" in the journal Viruses (https://doi.org/10.3390/v10070388).

The scripts listed in this repository are meant to be imported in R to be run. For scripts used to analyze the raw sequencing files please refer to the stenglein-lab github under the taxonomy_pipeline repository (https://github.com/stenglein-lab/taxonomy_pipeline). Raw sequencing files can be downloaded from the NCBI SRA under the BioProject PRJNA477560.

The purpose of this project was to look at the Ixodes scapularis tick microbiome in a holistic manner using shotgun metagenomic sequencing. From this holistic view, we aimed to identify potential functional relationships as identified by either co-occurrence or correlation trends.

If you have any questions, please feel to reach out to me.
